This course exposes you to real-life tools
This course is quite hard
But it's probably worth it.
Programming skills are a pre-requisite
If you passed, don't enroll again
We encourage learning by sharing

You CAN copy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam).

Why should you copy? Because in real life, there’s no time to re-invent the wheel. You’ll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It’s important to learn how to do that well.

To learn well, understand what you’re copying. If you’re short of time, prioritize.

To learn better, teach what you’ve learnt.

We cover 7 modules in 12 weeks
